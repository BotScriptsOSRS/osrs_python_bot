**DISCLAIMER:** because I am using python, the code cannot be used on other computers. This is due to that much of the code relies on the size of the screen and the scale of the screen. However, the code can be adjusted such that it works on your computer. Unfortunately I donâ€™t have the time at the moment to show you how to change it. But I am sure you can figure it out if you know a little bit of python.

This an ongoing project I am doing for fun to learn Python. I will be creating videos showcasing my scripts on my Youtube channel under the following playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNb18irH3CKdowd71WuKHVBxkYSox_4HZ.
